# Crowdfunding_ETL

In this project, we worked in a group to create an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. 

After we transformed the data, we created four CSV files <campaign.csv>, <contact.csv>, <category.csv> and <subcategory.csv>, and use the CSV file data to create an ERD <ERD_Crowdfunding.png> and a table schema <crowdfunding_db_schema.sql>.

Finally, we have uploaded the CSV file data into a Postgres database. We are able to successfully read the data uploaded with a few queries:

select * from category;
select * from subcategory;
select * from contact;
select * from campaign;

We collaborated and communicated regularly during the project. I have also cheked in with my group regularly and offered my support.
